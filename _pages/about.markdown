Hi I'm Martin! I am young web developer from Berlin, Germany.<br>
Beside backend development I'm also interested in many aspects of application
development like interface design. I usually tend to read and think
a lot about those things even if I don't explicitly need it for something.
I like to solve problems with their simplest possible solution.

When I'm not working I'm mostly [reading](http://www.readability.com/mklappstuhl/archives)
or hanging out with [friends](http://facebook.com/martinklepsch).

## About This Site
This site was coded mostly by hand in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).
It is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and uses Amazon S3 for static hosting.
Text is set in [Adelle](https://typekit.com/fonts/adelle-web)
and served by [Typekit](http://typekit.com).

I used the [Skeleton framework](http://getskeleton.com) to have a basic grid system and
a responsive design across different screen resolutions.

Some parts of this website are not implemented respecting best-practices. The reasons for
this are a) I don't care and b) I like to play with stuff.
