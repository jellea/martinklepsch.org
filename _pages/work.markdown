Before coming to Berlin in October 2010 I mostly worked for smaller companies and NGOs.
While my work is now mostly defined by programming I did a lot of design work then.

Beside some [fun work](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Fun-Relax-Chair/214211) I did for my
own I also designed a companies corporate identity and a lot of 
[print adverts](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Bibernelle-Newspaper-Ad/212182) for them.
When some people I knew decided to create a new label for high quality music and dance
events they asked me to design their [promotional
material](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Noblenights-Unplugged-Bar-/364199) and logo.

Doing design work I mostly focus on typography and to provide the most important
information in the most accessible way possible.

My first gig in Berlin was quite random. After applying for and joining a [local
junior enterprise](http://cct-ev.de) (a consultancy led by students) I was invited by one 
of my tech colleagues to work at his startup.
So I started working at [Pokerboni.com](http://pokerboni.com) with Ruby on Rails without
knowing much more than the underlying concepts. I learned a lot about the basics of 
application development with Rails there. 

After half a year I decided to move on and eventually found something great with
[madvertise](http://madvertise.com). Their application architecture and business goals were
by far more complicated than the ones I encountered earlier.
What I am taking away from my stay at madvertise is that a good continuous
integration/testing setup is worth a lot and that awareness of certain tools is important
when working in teams.

Right now I am looking for the *next* so don't hesitate to contact me. (May '12)
