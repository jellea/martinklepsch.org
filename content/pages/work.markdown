If you are looking for help with your Clojure(Script) project don't
hesitate to contact me.

In the past I've helped clients in the following areas:

- Design and implement rich client side applications.
- Solve build tool/tooling needs for existing projects.
- Create prototypes and iteratively develop them further.
- Transition existing systems to Clojure.
