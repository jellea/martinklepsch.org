in need of a capable developer-design-hybrid for your
project, look no further. I'm making internet professionally since
2010 with my position always being somewhere between developer and
designer. Since mid 2014 I'm mostly focusing on Clojure(Script) based
projects and support companies adopt Clojure(Script) and evolve
existing systems

Some recent projects I've been involved with:

### Enerkeep

If you are the owner of a photovoltaic system selling your energy to
the grid has made you good returns due to government incentives. As PV
systems become cheaper these incentives will be reduced and it becomes
more economic to consume your energy yourself. To do that you need a
battery but choosing one is a complex task. Enerkeep helps consumers
find the right battery and get it installed.

My involvement:

- Created a ClojureScript application that helps selecting a suited battery and integrated it into the site.
- Set up a continous integration pipeline that greatly reduced the effort of deploying new builds.
- Revised design and it's implementation that has been created by an external agency.

Before coming to Berlin in October 2010 I mostly worked for smaller companies and NGOs.
While my work is now mostly defined by programming I did a lot of design work then.

Beside some [fun work](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Fun-Relax-Chair/214211) I did for my
own I also designed a companies corporate identity and a lot of 
[print adverts](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Bibernelle-Newspaper-Ad/212182) for them.
When some people I knew decided to create a new label for high quality music and dance
events they asked me to design their [promotional
material](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Noblenights-Unplugged-Bar-/364199) and logo.

Doing design work I mostly focus on typography and to provide the most important
information in the most accessible way possible.

> A good test suite matters

My first gig in Berlin was quite random. After applying for and joining a [local
junior enterprise](http://cct-ev.de) (a consultancy led by students) I was invited by one 
of my tech colleagues to work at his startup.
So I started working at [Pokerboni.com](http://pokerboni.com) with Ruby on Rails without
knowing much more than the underlying concepts. I learned a lot about the basics of 
application development with Rails there. 

After half a year I decided to move on and eventually found something great with
[madvertise](http://madvertise.com). Their application architecture and business goals were
by far more complicated than the ones I encountered earlier.
What I am taking away from my stay at madvertise is that a good continuous
integration/testing setup is worth a lot and that awareness of certain tools is important
when working in teams.

Right now I am looking for the *next* so don't hesitate to contact me. (May '12)
